It didnt work for me. After I changed in the following files, it started working:
- broadcasting.php: 'encrypted': false
- if you used 'broadcastAs() { return "NewComment"; }' method, you should change in show.blade.php: .listen('.NewComment'). Check the Laravel documentation about that dot.ï»¿
     *
     * //ss I've checked this case (for custom channel names via broadcastAs), and found this:
     * 1. don't need to disable encryption from 'config/broadcasting.php/pusher.options.encrypted', and can just use as 'encrypted => true'
     * 2. recommended to have channel names without any dashes symbols (only alphabetical characters)
     * 3. in blade need to start with "." (dot) symbol for custom broadcast channel names
     */

    public function broadcastWith()
    {
        return [
            'body' => $this->comment->body,
            'created_at' => $this->comment->created_at->toFormattedDateString(),
            'user' => [
                'name' => $this->comment->user->name,
                'avatar' => 'http://lorempixel.com/50/50'
            ]
        ];
    }
}
